# Week 5

// Module 6 Strings and Classes 

Creating a class Item:
    - As instructed, my code creates an Item class with the attributes itemName as a string and quantity as an integer.
    - Implemented a saveToFile() to write data to items.txt in the format: itemName, quantity.
    - To read the data back and display it from the file, I added the method loadFromFile(). 
    
In int main: 
    - In my main, I created an Item as an instance, and used tool as my object to assign values to its members, itemName and quantity. Finally, writing the data to items.txt, I called saveToFile().

// Module 11:  Advanced Classes – Constructors & Destructors

Product class:

  - Made a Product class with private attributes, then added the attributes integer id, string name, and double price.
  - I initialize these values using a constructor, under the name Product. Then a destructor, ~Product, that displays a message on screen when the object is destroyed.
  - And created a method named printDetails() to display the product's information.
    

In int main: 
    
  - In my main, I created a Product object with the value of 639.50 and called printDetails(). This is what's needed to print the ID, the name of the product, and its price.
